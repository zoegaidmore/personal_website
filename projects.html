            <h3>I miss my DJ</h3>
            <p>
                Women In Computing is an organization at UCSD that supports women in the computer science field. As a 
                member of this organization, me and a group created an interactive website called I Miss My DJ. This 
                website won best interactive webstite out of all of the submissions for that quarter.

            <h3>Synthesis Research Project</h3>
            <p>
                As a part of the Syntehsis course series at UCSD, studnets have to do a research project. I completed
                my project on how the climate change crisis affects crime rates, as well as the importance of policies
                and policy education in fighting the climate change crisis.

            <h3>Happiness Index versus Urbanization Data Analysis</h3>
            
            <p>
                For COGS 108, a data science class at UCSD, I worked in a group to do research on happiness: what
                factors lead to higher happiness in a country? The key factor that we wanted to analyze was urbanization, 
                as we hypothesized that a higher proportion of a country living in an urban area would lead to higher
                happiness in that country. However, through our analysis, we found that that isn't always the case. We
                discovered that many factors, like a country's GDP, social support, life expectancy, and urbanization all
                impacted a country's happiness.
